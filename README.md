Causal inference of connectivity between neurons


When estimating connectivity between neurons, confounders are your enemy when
you desire an estimate that reflects the causal (mechanistic) influence
between neurons. Confounding arises when there is a common drive that
influences multiple neurons simultaneuously. For example, consider four neurons
A, B, C, and D, connected by the following graph:
